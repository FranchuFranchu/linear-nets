# `linear-nets`

A plan to build simple and type-checked nets by construction. Work in progress.

- [X] Simple net building implementation
- [-] Implement proof net reduction rules
  - [X] Times, Par, 1, False
  - [ ] Left, Right, With, True
  - [ ] Exp, Weak, Dere, Cntr
  - [ ] All, Any
- [-] Implement typesystem reduction rules
  - [X] Times, Par, 1, False
  - [ ] Left, Right, With, True
  - [ ] Exp, Weak, Dere, Cntr
  - [ ] All, Any
- [X] Implement parser
- [X] Implement AST -> Net compiler
  - [ ] Implement composing nets together
- [X] Add better displaying of nets
- [ ] Interaction combinator compiler for proof net
- [ ] Interaction combinator compiler for typesystem
- [ ] Compiler from interaction combinators to exzternal runtimes.
