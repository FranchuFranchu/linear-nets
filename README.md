# `linear-nets`

A plan to build simple and type-checked nets by construction. Work in progress.

- [X] Simple net building implementation
 - [ ] todo - settle on a free-port-list approach, or a stack-of-free-ports approach?
- [ ] Implement proof net reduction rules
- [ ] Implement typesystem reduction rules
- [ ] Implement parser
- [ ] Add better displaying of nets
- [ ] Interaction combinator compiler for proof net
- [ ] Interaction combinator compiler for typesystem
- [ ] Compiler from interaction combinators to exzternal runtimes.
